# Basic Scene

We need 4 elements to get started:

- A scene that will contain objects
- Some objects
- A camera
- A renderer

### Scene

The scene is like a container. You place your objects, models, particles, lights, etc. in it, and at some point, you ask Three.js to render that scene.

To create a scene, use the Scene class:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene()
```

### Objects

Objects can be many things. You can have primitive geometries, imported models, particles, lights, and so on.

We will start with a simple red cube.

To create that red cube, we need to create a type of object named **Mesh**. A **Mesh** is the combination of a **geometry** (the shape) and a material (how it looks).

There are many geometries and many materials, but we will keep things simple for now and create a [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) and a [MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial).

To create the geometry, we use the [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) class with the first 3 parameters that correspond to the box's size.

```javascript
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
```

To create the material, we use the [MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial) class with one parameter: an object `{}` containing all the options. All we need is to specify its `color` property.

There are many ways to specify a color in Three.js. You can send it as a JS hexadecimal `0xff0000`, you can send it as a string hexadecimal `'#ff0000'`, you can use color names like `'red'`, or you can send an instance of the [Color](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Color) class â€”we'll cover more about it later.

```javascript
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
```

To create the final mesh, we use the [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) class and send the `geometry` and the `material` as parameters.

```javascript
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
```

You can now add your mesh to the scene by using the `add(...)` method:

```javascript
scene.add(mesh)
```



### Camara

The camera is not visible. It's more like a theoretical point of view. When we will do a render of your scene, it will be from that camera's point of view.

You can have multiple cameras just like on a movie set, and you can switch between those cameras as you please. Usually, we only use one camera.

To create the camera, we use the [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) class.

There are two essential parameters we need to provide.

#### The field of view (fov)

The field of view is how large your vision angle is. If you use a very large angle, you'll be able to see in every direction at once but with much distortion, because the result will be drawn on a small rectangle. If you use a small angle, things will look zoomed in. The field of view (or `fov`) is expressed in degrees and corresponds to the vertical vision angle.

#### **The aspect ratio**

In most cases, the aspect ratio is the width of the canvas divided by its height.

```javascript
// Sizes
const sizes = {
    width: 800,
    height: 600
}

// Camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, sizes.width / sizes.height)
scene.add(camera)
```



### Renderer

We will simply ask the renderer to render our scene from the camera point of view, and the result will be drawn into a canvas. You can create the canvas by yourself, or let the renderer generate it and then add it to your page. For this exercise, we will add the canvas to the html and send it to the renderer.

Create the `<canvas>` element in HTML file **before** you load the scripts and give it a class:

```javascript
<canvas class="webgl"></canvas>
```

To create the renderer, we use the [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer) class with one parameter: an object `{}` containing all the options. We need to specify the `canvas` property corresponding to the `<canvas>` we added to the page.

Create a `canvas` variable at the start of the code, then fetch and store in it the element we created in the HTML using `document.querySelector(...)`.

We also need to update the size of your renderer with the `setSize(...)` method using the `sizes` object we created earlier. The `setSize(...)` method will automatically resize our `<canvas>` accordingly:

```javascript
// Canvas
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas.webgl')

// Renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
    canvas: canvas
})
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
```



### First Render

Call the `render(...)` method on the renderer and send it the `scene` and the `camera` as parameters:

```javascript
renderer.render(scene, camera)
```

the issue: we haven't specified our object's position, nor our camera's. Both are in the default position, which is the center of the scene and we can't see an object from its **inside** (by default).

We need to move things.

To do that, we have access to multiple properties on each object, such as `position`, `rotation`, and `scale`. For now, use the `position` property to move the camera backward.

The `position` property is an object with three relevant properties: `x`, `y` and `z`. By default, Three.js considers the forward/backward axis to be `z`.

To move the camera backward, we need to provide a positive value to that property. You can do that anywhere once you've created the `camera` variable, yet it has to happen before you do the render:

```javascript
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, sizes.width / sizes.height)
camera.position.z = 3
scene.add(camera)
```



### Code

```javascript
//scripts.js
// Scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene()

//Red Cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1)
const meterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'red'})
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, meterial)

//add to the scene
scene.add(mesh)

//Sizes
const sizes = {
    width: 800,
    height: 600
}

//Camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, sizes.width/sizes.height) //FOV and aspect ratio
camera.position.z = 3
camera.position.x = 1
//camera.position.y = 1
scene.add(camera)

//Renderer
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl')
console.log(canvas)
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
    canvas: canvas
})
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)

renderer.render(scene,camera)
```
