# 05410 Project -- TripPal

## General Reflection

I'm very excited to be working with my group to come up with such an application. At the very beginning, my mind was limited by the theme of this project, trip planning. I had been focusing on how to help people plan their travel schedules better, but I forgot about the main subject of travel, people.

My teammates gave me this inspiration. Before starting a trip, people always look for travel companions, family, friends, classmates or colleagues. However, some times people give up on a trip because they can't find a travel companion, or they find a tour group and have conflicts with the people in it resulting in a poor travel experience. So, we finally decided to focus on the starting point of our travel plan, finding travel companions.

Having determined the point of focus, we quickly raised our doubts. Is it acceptable for people to travel with "strangers". The four participants with different personalities provided us with a lot of good insights, and the person I interviewed was initially averse to traveling with strangers, because he was introverted and was reluctant to The subject I interviewed was initially averse to traveling with strangers because he was introverted and reluctant to initiate contact with strangers. During the interview, through the photos he brought, I gradually learned that the trip shown in the photos actually involved a stranger, a local guide. Gradually, he also found out that it would be a good choice to have a local person who was familiar with the local environment and could also help them understand the local culture better. I also found out through this research that local travel companions and concerns about safety are something we have to consider. Also, this research has taught me that when a person dismisses an idea, it doesn't mean they will never like the idea. To address each other's concerns and needs, users can also change their minds and choose a new way to travel.

After that, we did affinity clustering to get a lot of useful insights from the information we got from the artifact analysis, and then made two models, the empathy map and the user flow diagram. Finally, we combined the feedback from speed dating to come up with the final prototype.

This research made me realize the importance of group research. One person's idea will always be limited, and other voices are needed to break this limitation, so that more interesting ideas can be found.The regret of this time may be that we have less opportunity to communicate offline, several times offline communication is very efficient, ideas are exchanged faster and more effective. In the future, more research should be conducted offline, so that more ideas will emerge and better ideas will be noticed.

- My Role :  Research

# Executive Summary

### Goal

This study focuses on helping people find the right travel companions and assisting them in making the perfect travel plans.

### Insights

- People are most worried about security issues, how to help people to dispel this concern and do a good all-round protection mechanism is the key.
- People prefer to travel with locals so that they can better connect with the local community and go to the places that locals often visit.
- People do not feel comfortable traveling with complete strangers, but are willing to travel with people they have been talking to for a while online or people they have mutual friends with. 
- People need company, they need someone to look after them or someone to talk to.

# Problem

Many people give up the idea of travel because they don't have a travel partner. We want to help them find the right travel companion and make the perfect trip plan, make a good friend and have a great travel experience.

# Methods

We used a number of research methods to explore people's needs and concerns. This included analyzing the stakeholders and finding the right interviewers for artifact analysis, compiling the information from the different types of interviewees, obtaining interpretation notes, and then completing affinity clustering, which resulted in an empathy map and user flow diagram. Finally, we used the above information to create a storyboard and speed dating, and finally presented the prototype that you can see now.

# Evidence

> #### when fun things happen, someone can share
>
> ##### Someone to take care of you if you get sick
>
> ##### don't trust people meet online without a validation of identity
>
> ##### feel ok if to travel with someone who met online and talked online for a while (even tho not familiar in person)
>
> ##### like to find locals to navigate or introduce local culture



# Insights

- People are most worried about security issues, how to help people to dispel this concern and do a good all-round protection mechanism is the key.
- People prefer to travel with locals so that they can better connect with the local community and go to the places that locals often visit.
- People do not feel comfortable traveling with complete strangers, but are willing to travel with people they have been talking to for a while online or people they have mutual friends with. 
- People need company, they need someone to look after them or someone to talk to.



# Implications

- Firstly, we will use algorithm to match people with similar trip plan and maybe hobies, and people can contact with each other to settle down the whole trip plan.

- Also, we also provide service that helping people to decide where to go, and give them some suggestions. 
- For security issue, we have background checking to make sure the safe trip

- It is significant to make sure the budget, since budget things are always the cause of many conflict. Hence, we decide to let people make sure the budget of every item, making sure their trip can go through without conflict. 
- We also allow people to meet new friends in destination.
