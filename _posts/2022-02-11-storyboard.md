# Storyboards

A storyboard is an illustrated, step-by-step presentation describing how people will perform a target activities using your new product concepts.

- Storyboard depict how people will live life with your product
- Limit detail in each cell to encourage the team to start by designing the high level
- Create a set of core storyboards before desgining the product structure
- **We wait to design the product places and the user interface until we have the core storyboards.**
- Work on different storyboard cases in parallele small groups
- Storyboards are pictures of possible user interfaces and manual steps
- Ground your storyboard in your consolidated user data
- Draw storyboard cells last ---- create a clean neat version of your plan for the user.



## Example

**Travel Planing**

#### Instructions

1. Begin with the **Mini Creative Matrix**

2. 1. Select a How Might We Statement related to our problem space of travel planning.
   2. Take the first 5 minutes to individually come up with ideas at the intersection of the HMW (How Might We) statement and each enabler on the left side of the matrix.

3.  identify one of the ideas to build your prototype around.

4. Discuss the idea and agree upon a shared vision and understanding. It might help to have the person who wrote it on the sticky note share what they were thinking and then have others build onto that idea by saying, “yes, and...”

5. After you’ve agreed on an idea and have a shared understanding of that idea, you should identify one key part of the experience to focus on. You will build your storyboard with that part of the experience in mind.

6. Build a rough approximation of the experience in the three frames of the storyboard, as shown on the template. *(Remember, you aren’t trying to design a UI here, you are mapping out the experience. It may help to follow this format (see sample below):*

7. - *First panel sets up the scenario and shows a need that exists for a person.*
   - *Second panel illustrates the idea and how it solves a need.*
   - *Third panel demonstrates the outcome.*
